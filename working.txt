-- When the index.html is rendered createNewArray function is called with default 60 no. of bars.

-- The array size and the speed of the visulazer is a range value which is set to the mid of the maximum and minimum of the range value.

-- In order to access any class document query selector function from DOM(Document Object Module) is used.

-- Whenever the generateNewArray button is clicked an event listner function is called which triggers certain functions defined inside it.
-- Whenever the slider for the size of the array is adjusted then an event listener function is called which further calls createNewArray function.

-- Whenever the slider for the speed is adjusted then an event listner function is called which calculates the delay time to be implimented between two 
   comparisions by substracting the given input value from a fixed value, thus ensuring that the delay is less if the input given for the speed is large.

-- When any sorting button is clicked the corresponding sort function is called by the even listner function.

-- For imparting colors to the bars we are just changing the color styling of that particular bar div component which are being compared in the standard sorting algorithm.

-- While calling any sorting function it is very important that we add a delay of some milliseconds otherwise the array will be sorted at once and we will not
   be able to visualize the sorting process.
